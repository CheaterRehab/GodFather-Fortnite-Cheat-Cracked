Crack of a detected Fortnite Cheat by the https://cheater.rehab/ team.


After using a 0day exploit we have in keyauth to bypass the login it then runs a system command that stops windows management instrumentation. It follows that by loading "their" driver using Kdmapper from a byte array which is very easy to dump.

"Their" driver abuses FlushFileBuffers because it calls IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS in kernal which is very easy to hook this has been done many many times and there are public methods on how to do this 


this repo contains not only there driver but also the usermode for how to communicatie with it.
