Crack of a detected Fortnite Cheat by the https://cheater.rehab/ team.


After using a 0day exploit we have in keyauth to bypass the login it then runs a system command that stops Windows Management Instrumentation. It follows that by loading "their" driver using Kdmapper from a byte array which is very easy to dump.

Possible Detection Vectors


"Their" driver abuses FlushFileBuffers because it calls IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS in kernal which is very easy to hook this has been done many many times and there are public methods on how to do this so there is 0 way this isnt detetcted.

Mouse_event is used for the aimbot 


this repo contains not only there driver but also the usermode for how to communicatie with it.
