# GodPaster Private External Fortnite Cheat Cracked & meme'd
Crack of a detected Fortnite Cheat by the https://cheater.rehab/ team.

mod aka !mod#9659 (ID: 597485373194764311) is a fraud

This guy is selling a popular fortnite "Private" External called "GodFather". 
The cheat that he is selling is a simple copy + paste and is detected to dear shit on EAC/BE. Loader wasnt even protected...

Credits to: UCFoxi so the kid can paste off of his driver communication method.
 
"Their" driver abuses FlushFileBuffers because it calls IRP_MJ_FLUSH_BUFFERS in the kernel. There are public methods on how to do this so there is 0 way this isnt detetcted.

After a client-side bypass we have in keyauth to bypass the login it then runs a system command that stops Windows Management Instrumentation. It follows that by loading "their" driver using Kdmapper from a byte array (downloaded from keyauth's servers) which is very easy to dump.

Simple anti-pasta has been added to the driver and the source code to avoid further pasting, it should be straightfoward to figure out if you have a half brain.

there are precompiled binaries on the right side of this page, have fun.

enjoy
